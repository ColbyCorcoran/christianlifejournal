# Scripture Auto-Fill Feature Setup Instructions

## Overview

Your Christian Life Journal app now includes a scripture auto-fill feature similar to Spirit Notes! Users can type scripture references (like "John 3:16" or "Romans 8:28-30") and automatically expand them to include the full verse text from the King James Version Bible.

## Files Added

### 1. Service Layer
- `Services/ScriptureAutoFillService.swift` - Core auto-fill logic with pattern recognition and verse lookup

### 2. UI Components  
- `Views/Components/ScriptureAutoFillTextField.swift` - Auto-fill enabled text fields
- `Views/Components/ScriptureAutoFillTestView.swift` - Test view for demonstration

### 3. Bible Data
- `KJV_bible.json` - Complete King James Version Bible text (4.6MB)

### 4. Updated Views
- `Views/Add Entry Views/AddPersonalTimeView.swift` - Title and notes fields now support auto-fill
- `Views/Add Entry Views/AddScriptureMemoryView.swift` - Verse text fields now support auto-fill

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Add KJV_bible.json to Xcode Project

**IMPORTANT**: The KJV Bible JSON file needs to be added to your Xcode project bundle:

1. Open your project in Xcode
2. Right-click on your project root in the navigator
3. Select "Add Files to 'Christian Life Journal'"
4. Navigate to and select `KJV_bible.json`
5. Make sure "Add to target: Christian Life Journal" is checked
6. Click "Add"

### Step 2: Build and Test

1. Build the project (`Cmd+B`)
2. Run the app (`Cmd+R`)
3. Navigate to any entry creation view (Personal Time, Scripture Memory, etc.)
4. Test the auto-fill functionality

## How It Works

### For Users
1. **Type a scripture reference** in any supported text field:
   - "John 3:16"
   - "Romans 8:28"
   - "Psalms 23:1-3"
   - "Matt 5:8" (abbreviations supported)

2. **Auto-fill button appears** when scripture references are detected

3. **Tap the button** to expand references to full verse text:
   - "John 3:16" becomes "John 3:16 - For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

### Supported Reference Formats
- **Single verses**: "John 3:16", "Romans 8:28"
- **Verse ranges**: "John 3:16-17", "Psalms 23:1-3"
- **Book abbreviations**: "Matt", "Gen", "Rom", "1 Cor", "Rev"
- **Number prefixes**: "1 Kings", "2 Chronicles", "3 John"

### Pattern Recognition
The service uses regular expressions to detect scripture patterns:
- Matches book names and common abbreviations from your `BibleBooks.swift`
- Handles chapter:verse notation
- Supports verse ranges with hyphens
- Case-insensitive matching

## Settings & Preferences
